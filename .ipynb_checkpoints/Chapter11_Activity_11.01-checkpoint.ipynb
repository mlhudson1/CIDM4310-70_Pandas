Now, it is apparent that R1 to R7 are one kind of sensor and R8 to R14 are the other kind. The data was collected to evaluate the performance of the senors measuring CO at various conditions of temperature and humidity. In particular, the humidity is taken to be an \"uncontrolled variable\", and during tests, random levels of humidity were imposed. In the field, the humidity would not be controlled or measured, which impacts the interpretation of data, especially for low levels of CO. The sensors output is reported as resistance in MOhms, which are the main independent variables with which to predict CO. Temperature and the voltage applied to the sensor heater are also available.\n",

Reviewing the figure, not that although the CO values are shown and nearly constant, there is a lag time in the humidity and sensor resistance values. A possible approach would be to average readings. A simple test of this idea is to group by the CO values and take the mean sensor values, and the model with those. In addition, it seems reasonable to filter out the regions where the resistance values drop to low values, as those seem anamolous."
